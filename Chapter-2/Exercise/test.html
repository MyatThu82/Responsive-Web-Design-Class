    <p>I did like Ben's book, but he kept going on about scones. For examples:</p>
    <blockquote>
        l this writing about scones in our sample page and there's no
        image of the beauties! I'm going to add in an image of a scone near
        the top of the page; a sort of 'hero' image to entice users to read
        the page.

        <summary> I ate 15 scones in one day</summary>
        <p>Of course I didn't. It would probably kill me if I did. What
            a way to go.
            Mmmmmm, scones!
